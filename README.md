Journey of creating a game using python and the pygame library

plan for game is to create a turn based game which contains different characters of different stats. One can choose which character they want to pick. Each character has custom moves exclusive to them. Planning on adding extra elements such as potions or buffs that add certain advantages when used. The game ends when one character's health hits zero.
